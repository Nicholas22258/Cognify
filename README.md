Our app aims to make learning more interactive and motivate students to achieve their best academic grades possible. 
We have created an app that allows users to upload study material, mainly pdfs and learn that material by playing either a word matching game,
a definition builder or a cross word puzzle.
 
We are trying to provide alternative methods of learning apart from traditional methods which according to our research 
does not keep students attentive and motivated. Whereas gamified learning keeps things interesting for students and motivated them to continue learning 
instead of eventually losing interest and motivation as most students do after some time.
 
We have used android studio to create the UI (using xml), java for the functionality and Firebase as our database.
